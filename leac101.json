Thus, no interest on capital is payable if the partnership deed\nis silent on the issue.\n(c) Interest on Drawings: No interest is to be charged on the drawings made\nby the partners, if there is no mention in the Deed.\n(d) Interest on Loan: If any partner has advanced loan to the firm for the\npurpose of business, he/she shall be entitled to get an interest on the\nloan amount at the rate of 6 per cent per annum.\n(e) Remuneration for Firm's Work: No partner is entitled to get salary or\nother remuneration for taking part in the conduct of the business of the\nfirm unless there is a provision for the same in the Partnership Deed.\nApart from the above, the Indian Partnership Act specifies that subject to\ncontract between the partners:\n(i) If a partner derives any profit for him/her self from any transaction of the\nfirm or from the use of the property or business connection of the firm or\nthe firm name, he/she shall account for the profit and pay it to the firm.\n(ii) If a partner carries on any business of the same nature as and competing\nwith that of the firm, he/she shall account for and pay to the firm, all\nprofit made by him/her in that business.\nTest your Understanding - I\n1.

It details the allocation of a net profit of 1,20,000 among the partners. Mahesh's share is initially 72,000, but after accounting for a deficiency share of 7,800, his final amount is 64,200. Dinesh's share is 36,000, reduced by a deficiency share of 5,200, resulting in a final amount of 30,800. Rakesh's share is 12,000, but he receives additional amounts from Mahesh and Dinesh's deficiency shares, totaling 25,000. The working notes explain the new profit-sharing ratio and how deficiencies are shared among the partners.",

As the business expands, one needs more capital and a larger number of people to manage the business and share its risks. In such a situation, people usually adopt the partnership form of organisation. Accounting for partnership firms has its own peculiarities, as the partnership firm comes into existence when two or more persons come together to establish business and share its profits. On many issues affecting distribution of profits, there may not be any specific agreement between the partners. In such a situation the provisions of the Indian Partnership Act 1932 apply. Similarly, calculation of interest on capital, interest on drawings and maintenance of partners' capital accounts have their own peculiarities. Not only that a variety of adjustments are required on the death of a partner or when a new partner is admitted and so on. These peculiar situations need specific treatment in accounting that need to be clarified. The present chapter discusses some basic aspects of partnership such as distribution of profit, maintenance of capital accounts, etc. The treatment of situations like admission of partner, retirement, death and dissolution have been taken up in the subsequent chapters.",

As the business expands, one needs more capital and a larger number of people to manage the business and share its risks. In such a situation, people usually adopt the partnership form of organisation. Accounting for partnership firms has its own peculiarities, as the partnership firm comes into existence when two or more persons come together to establish business and share its profits. On many issues affecting distribution of profits, there may not be any specific agreement between the partners. In such a situation the provisions of the Indian Partnership Act 1932 apply. Similarly, calculation of interest on capital, interest on drawings and maintenance of partners' capital accounts have their own peculiarities. Not only that a variety of adjustments are required on the death of a partner or when a new partner is admitted and so on. These peculiar situations need specific treatment in accounting that need to be clarified.

Thus, the essential features of partnership are:\",\n    \"features\": {\n      \"1. Two or More Persons\": \"In order to form a partnership, there should be at least two persons coming together for a common goal. In other words, the minimum number of partners in a firm can be two. There is, however, a limit on their maximum number. By virtue of Section 464 of the Companies Act 2013, the Central Government is empowered to prescribe the maximum number of partners in a firm, but the number of partners cannot be more than 100. The Central Government has prescribed the maximum number of partners in a firm to be 50.\",\n      \"2. Agreement\": \"Partnership is the result of an agreement between two or more persons to do business and share its profits and losses. The agreement becomes the basis of the relationship between the partners. It is not necessary that such an agreement is in written form. An oral agreement is equally valid. However, in order to avoid disputes, it is preferred that the partners have a written agreement.\",\n      \"3. Business\": \"The agreement should be to carry on some business. Mere co-ownership of a property does not amount to partnership. For example, if Rohit and Sachin jointly purchase a plot of land, they become the joint owners of the property and not partners. But if they are in the business of purchase and sale of land for the purpose of making a profit, they will be called partners.\",\n      \"4. Mutual Agency\": \"The business of a partnership concern may be carried on by all the partners or any of them acting for all. This statement has two important implications. First, every partner is entitled to participate in the conduct of the affairs of the business. Second, there exists a relationship of mutual agency between all the partners. Each partner carrying on the business is both the principal and the agent for all the other partners. He can bind other partners by his acts and is also bound by the acts of other partners with regard to the business of the firm. The relationship of mutual agency is so important that one can say that there would be no partnership if the element of mutual agency is absent.\",\n      \"5. Sharing of Profit\": \"Another important element of partnership is that the agreement between partners must be to share the profits and losses of a business. Though the definition contained in the Partnership Act describes partnership as a relation between people who agree to share the profits of a business, the sharing of loss is implied. Thus, sharing of profits and losses is a fundamental aspect of partnership.\"\n    },\n    \"date\": \"2024-25\"\n  }\n}"

They contributed Rs. 4,00,000 and Rs. 1,00,000 respectively as capitals. In addition, Raju advanced Rs. 2,00,000 as a loan to the firm on October 1, 2019. Raju had met with an accident on July 1, 2017, and could not attend the business up to September 30, 2017. The profit for the year ended March 31, 2020, amounted to Rs. 50,600. Disputes have arisen between them regarding the sharing of the profits of the firm.\n\n   Raju Claims:\n   (i) He should be given interest at 10% per annum on both capital and loan.\n   (ii) Profit should be distributed in the proportion of capitals.\n\n   Jai Claims:\n   (i) Net profit should be shared equally.\n   (ii) He should be allowed remuneration of Rs. 1,000 per annum during the period of Raju's illness.\n   (iii) Interest on capital and loan should be given at 6% per annum.\n\n   State the correct position on each issue as per the provisions of the Partnership Act, 1932.\n\n2. Reena and Raman are partners with capitals of Rs. 3,00,000 and Rs. 1,00,000 respectively. The profit for the year ended March 31, 2020, was Rs. 1,80,000, before paying rent for her personal building to be used as a godown for the firm, to Reena, payable at Rs. 5,000 per month. Interest on capital is to be allowed at 6% per annum. Raman was entitled to a salary of Rs. 30,000 per annum. The drawings of partners were Rs. 30,000 and Rs. 20,000. The interest on drawings to be charged to Reena was Rs. 1,000 and to Raman, Rs. 500.\n\n   Assuming that Reena and Raman are equal partners, state their share of profit after necessary appropriations.\n\n   Note: Payment of rent to Reena is an expense for the business.

When the Deed specifically provides for it, interest on capital is applicable.\ncredited to the partners at the agreed rate with reference to the time period for which the capital remained in business during a financial year. Interest on capital is generally provided for in two situations: (i) when the partners contribute unequal amounts of capital but share profits equally, and (ii) where the capital contribution is the same but profit sharing is unequal.\n\nInterest on capital is calculated with due allowance for any addition or withdrawal of capital during the accounting period. For example, Mohini, Rashmi, and Navin entered into partnership, bringing in Rs. 3,00,000, Rs. 2,00,000, and Rs. 1,00,000 respectively into the business. They decided to share profits and losses equally and agreed that interest on capital will be provided to the partners at a rate of 10 percent per annum. There was no addition or withdrawal of capital by any partner during the year. The interest on capital works out to Rs. 30,000 (10% on Rs. 3,00,000) for Mohini, Rs. 20,000 (10% on Rs. 2,00,000) for Rashmi, and Rs. 10,000 (10% on Rs. 1,00,000) for Navin.\n\nTake another case of Mansoor and Reshma, who are partners in a firm, and their capital accounts showed the balance of Rs. 2,00,000 and Rs. 1,50,000 respectively on April 1, 2019. Mansoor introduced additional capital of Rs. 1,00,000 on August 1, 2019, and Reshma brought in further capital of Rs. 1,50,000 on October 1, 2019. Interest is to be allowed at a rate of 6% per annum on the capitals. It shall be worked out as follows:\n\nFor Mansoor: \nRs. 2,00,000 × (6/100) × (12/12) = Rs. 12,000 \n+ Rs. 1,00,000 × (6/100) × (5/12) = Rs. 4,000 \n= Total Interest = Rs. 16,000\n\nFor Reshma: \nRs. 1,50,000 × (6/100) × (12/12) = Rs. 9,000 \n+ Rs. 1,50,000 × (6/100) × (3/12) = Rs. 2,250 \n= Total Interest = Rs. 11,250\n= Rs. 9,000 + Rs. 4,500 = Rs. 13,500\n\nWhen there are both additions and withdrawals of capital by the partners during a financial year, the interest on capital is calculated as follows:\n\n(i) On the opening balance of the capital accounts of partners, interest is calculated for the whole year;\n\n(ii) On the additional capital brought in by any partner during the year, interest is calculated from the date of introduction of the additional capital to the last day of the financial year.\n\n(iii) In the case of withdrawal of capital, interest on capital will be calculated as follows: On the opening capital from the beginning of the year until the date of capital withdrawn, and then on the reduced capital for the remaining time period.

            "suggestedText": "Test your Understanding – II\n\n1. Raju and Jai commenced business in partnership on April 1, 2019. No partnership agreement was made, whether oral or written. They contributed Rs. 4,00,000 and Rs. 1,00,000 respectively as capitals. In addition, Raju advanced Rs. 2,00,000 as a loan to the firm on October 1, 2019. Raju had met with an accident on July 1, 2017, and could not attend the business up to September 30, 2017. The profit for the year ended March 31, 2020, amounted to Rs. 50,600. Disputes have arisen between them regarding the sharing of the profits of the firm.\n\n   Raju Claims:\n   (i) He should be given interest at 10% per annum on both capital and loan.\n   (ii) Profit should be distributed in the proportion of capitals.\n\n   Jai Claims:\n   (i) Net profit should be shared equally.\n   (ii) He should be allowed remuneration of Rs. 1,000 per annum during the period of Raju's illness.\n   (iii) Interest on capital and loan should be given at 6% per annum.\n\n   State the correct position on each issue as per the provisions of the Partnership Act, 1932.\n\n2. Reena and Raman are partners with capitals of Rs. 3,00,000 and Rs. 1,00,000 respectively. The profit for the year ended March 31, 2020, was Rs. 1,80,000, before paying rent for her personal building to be used as a godown for the firm, to Reena, payable at Rs. 5,000 per month. Interest on capital is to be allowed at 6% per annum. Raman was entitled to a salary of Rs. 30,000 per annum. The drawings of partners were Rs. 30,000 and Rs. 20,000. The interest on drawings to be charged to Reena was Rs. 1,000 and to Raman, Rs. 500.\n\n   Assuming that Reena and Raman are equal partners, state their share of profit after necessary appropriations.\n\n   Note: Payment of rent to Reena is an expense for the business. Hence, it is charged against profits.\n\n1.5.2 Interest on Capital\n\nNo interest is allowed on partners' capitals unless it is expressly agreed upon among the partners. When the Deed specifically provides for it, interest on capital is applicable.\ncredited to the partners at the agreed rate with reference to the time period for which the capital remained in business during a financial year. Interest on capital is generally provided for in two situations: (i) when the partners contribute unequal amounts of capital but share profits equally, and (ii) where the capital contribution is the same but profit sharing is unequal.\n\nInterest on capital is calculated with due allowance for any addition or withdrawal of capital during the accounting period. For example, Mohini, Rashmi, and Navin entered into partnership, bringing in Rs. 3,00,000, Rs. 2,00,000, and Rs. 1,00,000 respectively into the business. They decided to share profits and losses equally and agreed that interest on capital will be provided to the partners at a rate of 10 percent per annum. There was no addition or withdrawal of capital by any partner during the year. The interest on capital works out to Rs. 30,000 (10% on Rs. 3,00,000) for Mohini, Rs. 20,000 (10% on Rs. 2,00,000) for Rashmi, and Rs. 10,000 (10% on Rs. 1,00,000) for Navin.\n\nTake another case of Mansoor and Reshma, who are partners in a firm, and their capital accounts showed the balance of Rs. 2,00,000 and Rs. 1,50,000 respectively on April 1, 2019. Mansoor introduced additional capital of Rs. 1,00,000 on August 1, 2019, and Reshma brought in further capital of Rs. 1,50,000 on October 1, 2019. Interest is to be allowed at a rate of 6% per annum on the capitals. It shall be worked out as follows:\n\nFor Mansoor: \nRs. 2,00,000 × (6/100) × (12/12) = Rs. 12,000 \n+ Rs. 1,00,000 × (6/100) × (5/12) = Rs. 4,000 \n= Total Interest = Rs. 16,000\n\nFor Reshma: \nRs. 1,50,000 × (6/100) × (12/12) = Rs. 9,000 \n+ Rs. 1,50,000 × (6/100) × (3/12) = Rs. 2,250 \n= Total Interest = Rs. 11,250\n= Rs. 9,000 + Rs. 4,500 = Rs. 13,500\n\nWhen there are both additions and withdrawals of capital by the partners during a financial year, the interest on capital is calculated as follows:\n\n(i) On the opening balance of the capital accounts of partners, interest is calculated for the whole year;\n\n(ii) On the additional capital brought in by any partner during the year, interest is calculated from the date of introduction of the additional capital to the last day of the financial year.\n\n(iii) In the case of withdrawal of capital, interest on capital will be calculated as follows: On the opening capital from the beginning of the year until the date of capital withdrawn, and then on the reduced capital for the remaining time period. Alternatively, it can be calculated with respect to the amount remaining in the business for the relevant period.\n\n**Financial Year: 2024-25**\n\n**Accounting for Partnership: Basic Concepts**\n\n**Illustration 5**\n\nSaloni and Srishti are partners in a firm.

Profits before charging interest on capital were Rs. 50,000. Rani and Suman shared profits in the ratio of 3:2. Calculate the amounts of interest on their capitals at 12% per annum for the year ended March 31, 2020.\\n\\n2. Priya and Kajal are partners in a firm, sharing profits and losses in the ratio of 5:3. The balance in their fixed capital accounts on April 1, 2019, was: Priya, Rs. 6,00,000 and Kajal, Rs. 8,00,000. The profit of the firm for the year ended March 31, 2020, was Rs. 1,26,000. Calculate their shares of profits: (a) when there was no agreement in respect of interest on capital, and (b) when there is an agreement that the interest on capital will be allowed at 12% per annum.\\n\\n1.5.3 Interest on Drawings\"\n}\nThe partnership agreement may also provide for the charging of interest on money withdrawn from the firm by the partners for their personal use. As stated earlier, no interest is charged on the drawings if there is no express agreement among the partners regarding it. However, if the partnership deed provides for it, the interest is charged at an agreed rate for the period during which the drawings have been made. This amount remains outstanding from the partners during an accounting year. Charging interest on drawings discourages excessive amounts of withdrawals by the partners."

Hence, no interest will be allowed during the year if the firm has incurred a net loss. Additionally, if in a year the profit of the firm is less than the amount due to the partners as interest on capital, the payment of interest will be restricted to the amount of profits. In that case, the profit will be effectively distributed in the ratio of interest on capital of each partner.\n\n**2024-25**  \n**Accounting for Partnership: Basic Concepts**  \n**Illustration 7**  \nAnupam and Abhishek are partners sharing profits and losses in the ratio of 3:2.

Anupam and Abhishek will be credited with Rs. 6,000 and Rs. 8,000, respectively. Effectively, this amounts to sharing the firm's profit in the ratio of interest on capital, i.e., 3:4.\\n\\n2024-25\\nAccountancy - Partnership Accounts\\nTest your Understanding\\n\\n1. Rani and Suman are in partnership with fixed capitals of Rs. 80,000 and Rs. 60,000, respectively. During the year 2019-20, Rani withdrew Rs. 10,000 from her capital and Suman withdrew Rs. 15,000. Profits before charging interest on capital were Rs. 50,000. Rani and Suman shared profits in the ratio of 3:2. Calculate the amounts of interest on their capitals at 12% per annum for the year ended March 31, 2020.\\n\\n2. Priya and Kajal are partners in a firm, sharing profits and losses in the ratio of 5:3. The balance in their fixed capital accounts on April 1, 2019, was: Priya, Rs. 6,00,000 and Kajal, Rs. 8,00,000. The profit of the firm for the year ended March 31, 2020, was Rs. 1,26,000. Calculate their shares of profits: (a) when there was no agreement in respect of interest on capital, and (b) when there is an agreement that the interest on capital will be allowed at 12% per annum.\\n\\n1.5.3 Interest on Drawings\"\n}\nThe partnership agreement may also provide for the charging of interest on money withdrawn from the firm by the partners for their personal use. As stated earlier, no interest is charged on the drawings if there is no express agreement among the partners regarding it. However, if the partnership deed provides for it, the interest is charged at an agreed rate for the period during which the drawings have been made. This amount remains outstanding from the partners during an accounting year. Charging interest on drawings discourages excessive amounts of withdrawals by the partners.\n\nThe calculation of interest on drawings under different situations is shown as follows:\n\n**When Fixed Amounts are Withdrawn Every Month**  \nOften, a fixed amount of money is withdrawn by the partners at equal time intervals, such as each month or each quarter. While calculating the time period, attention must be paid to whether the fixed amount was withdrawn at the beginning (first day), middle of the month, or at the end (last day) of the month. If withdrawn on the first day of every month, interest on the total amount will be calculated for 6½ months; if withdrawn at the end of every month, it will be calculated for 5½ months; and if withdrawn during the middle of the month, it will be calculated for 6 months.\n\nSuppose Aashish withdrew Rs. 10,000 per month from the firm for his personal use during the year ending March 31, 2017. The calculation of the average period and the interest on drawings in different situations would be as follows:\n\n(a) **When the amount is withdrawn at the beginning of each month:**  \nAverage Period  \nNumber of months of first drawings + Number of months of last drawings  \n= 12 + 1  \n= 6 months.  \n\n**Financial Year:** 2024-25  \n**Accounting for Partnership: Basic Concepts**",

Rani and Suman are in partnership with fixed capitals of Rs, 80,000 and Rs.\n60,000, respectively. During the year 2019-20, Rani withdrew Rs. 10,000 from\nher capital and Suman Rs. 15,000. Profits before charging interest on capital\nwas Rs. 50,000. Rani and Suman shared profits in the ratio of 3:2. Calculate\nthe amounts of interest on their capitals @ 12% p.a. for the year ended March\n31, 2020.\n2. Priya and Kajal are partners in a firm, sharing profits and losses in the ratio of\n5:3. The balance in their fixed capital accounts, on April 1, 2019 were: Priya,\nRs. 6,00,000 and Kajal, Rs. 8,00,000. The profit of the firm for the year ended\nMarch 31, 2020 was Rs, 1,26,000. Calculate their shares of profits: (a) when\nthere was no agreement in respect of interest on capital, and (b) when there is\nan agreement that the interest on capital will be allowed @ 12% p.a.\n1.5.3 Interest on Drawings\nex\nThe partnership agreement may also provide for charging of interest on money\nwithdrawn out of the firm by the partners for their personal use. As stated earlier,\nno interest is charged on the drawings if there is no express agreement among the\npartners about it. However if the partnership deed so provides for it, the interest is\ncharged at an agreed rate, for the period for which drawings have been made.\nRemained outstanding from the partners during an accounting year. Charging\ninterest on drawings discourages excessive amounts of drawings by the partners.\nThe calculation of interest on drawings under different situations is shown\nas here under.\nWhen Fixed Amounts was Withdrawn Every Month\nMany a time, a fixed amount of money is withdrawn by the partners, at equal\ntime interval, say each month or each quarter. While calculating the time period,\nattention must be paid to whether the fixed amount was withdrawn at the\nbeginning (first day) of the month, middle of the month or at the end (last day) of\nthe month. If withdrawn on the first day of every month, interest on total amount\nwill be calculated for 6½ months; if withdrawn at the end at every month, it will\nbe calculated for 5½ months, and if withdrawn during the middle of the month,\nit will be calculated for 6 months.\nSuppose, Aashish withdrew Rs. 10,000 per month from the firm for his personal\nuse during the year ending March 31, 2017. The calculation of average period\nand the interest on drawings, in different situations would be as follows:\n(a) When the amount is withdrawn at the beginning of each month:\nAverage Period\nNo. of months of 1 drawings + No. of month of last drawings\n=\n12 + 1\n= 6\nmonths .\n2024-25\nAccounting for Partnership: Basic Concepts"

Effectively this\namounts to sharing the firm's profit in the ratio of interest on capital,\ni.e., 3:4.\n2024-25\nAccountancy - Partnership Accounts\nTest your Understanding\n-\nIII\n1. Rani and Suman are in partnership with fixed capitals of Rs, 80,000 and Rs.\n60,000, respectively. During the year 2019-20, Rani withdrew Rs. 10,000 from\nher capital and Suman Rs. 15,000. Profits before charging interest on capital\nwas Rs. 50,000. Rani and Suman shared profits in the ratio of 3:2. Calculate\nthe amounts of interest on their capitals @ 12% p.a. for the year ended March\n31, 2020.\n2. Priya and Kajal are partners in a firm, sharing profits and losses in the ratio of\n5:3. The balance in their fixed capital accounts, on April 1, 2019 were: Priya,\nRs. 6,00,000 and Kajal, Rs. 8,00,000. The profit of the firm for the year ended\nMarch 31, 2020 was Rs, 1,26,000. Calculate their shares of profits: (a) when\nthere was no agreement in respect of interest on capital, and (b) when there is\nan agreement that the interest on capital will be allowed @ 12% p.a.\n1.5.3 Interest on Drawings\nex\nThe partnership agreement may also provide for charging of interest on money\nwithdrawn out of the firm by the partners for their personal use. As stated earlier,\nno interest is charged on the drawings if there is no express agreement among the\npartners about it. However if the partnership deed so provides for it, the interest is\ncharged at an agreed rate, for the period for which drawings have been made.\nRemained outstanding from the partners during an accounting year. Charging\ninterest on drawings discourages excessive amounts of drawings by the partners.\nThe calculation of interest on drawings under different situations is shown\nas here under.\nWhen Fixed Amounts was Withdrawn Every Month\nMany a time, a fixed amount of money is withdrawn by the partners, at equal\ntime interval, say each month or each quarter. While calculating the time period,\nattention must be paid to whether the fixed amount was withdrawn at the\nbeginning (first day) of the month, middle of the month or at the end (last day) of\nthe month. If withdrawn on the first day of every month, interest on total amount\nwill be calculated for 6½ months; if withdrawn at the end at every month, it will\nbe calculated for 5½ months, and if withdrawn during the middle of the month,\nit will be calculated for 6 months.\nSuppose, Aashish withdrew Rs. 10,000 per month from the firm for his personal\nuse during the year ending March 31, 2017. The calculation of average period\nand the interest on drawings, in different situations would be as follows:\n(a) When the amount is withdrawn at the beginning of each month:\nAverage Period\nNo. of months of 1 drawings + No. of month of last drawings\n=\n12 + 1\n= 6\nmonths .\n2024-25\nAccounting for Partnership: Basic Concepts"

As per this ratio,\nMadhulika's share in profit comes to Rs.40,000 (2/6 of Rs. 1,20,000); Rakshita,\nRs. 60,000 (3/6 of Rs. 1,20,000) and Kanishka Rs. 20,000 (1/6 of Rs. 1,20,000).\nThe share of Kanishka works out to be Rs.5,000 short of the guaranteed amount.\nThis shall be borne by the guaranteeing partners Madhulika and Rakshita in\n2024-25\nAccounting for Partnership: Basic Concepts\ntheir profit sharing ratio, which in this case is 2:3, Madhulika's share in the\ndeficiency comes to Rs.2,000 (2/5 of Rs. 5,000), and that of Rakshita Rs.3,000.\nThe total profit of the firm will be distributed among the partners as follows\nMadhulika will get Rs.38,000 (her share 40,000 minus share in deficiency\nRs.2,000); Rakshita Rs.57,000 (60,000-3,000) and Kanishka Rs. 25,000\n(Rs. 20,000+ Rs. 2,000 + Rs. 3,000).\nIf only one partner gives the guarantee, say in the above case, only Rakshita\ngives the guarantee, the whole amount of deficiency (Rs.5,000) will be borne by\nher only. In that case profit distribution will be Madhulika Rs.40,000, Rakshita\nRs. 55,000 (60,000-5,000) and Kanishka Rs. 25,000 (Rs. 20,000 + Rs. 5,000).\nIllustration 10\nMohit and Rohan share profits and losses in the ratio of 2:1.

Verma withdraws\nRs. 2,000 per month starting from April 01, 2019 to March 31, 2020. Kaul\nwithdrew Rs, 3,000 per quarter, starting from April 01, 2019. Calculate interest\non partner's drawings.\nWhen Dates of Withdrawal are not specified\nWhen the total amount withdrawn is given but the dates of withdrawals are not\nspecified, it is assumed that the amount was withdrawn evenly throughout the\nyear. For example; Shakila withdrew Rs. 60,000 from partnership firm during\nthe year ending March 31, 2020 and the interest on drawings is to be charged\nat the rate of 8 per cent per annum. For calculation of interest, the period would\nbe taken as six months, which is the average period assuming, that amount is\nwithdrawn evenly in the middle of the month, throughout the year. The amount\nof interest on drawings works out to be Rs. 2,400 as follows:\nRs.60,000 ×\n8\n100 12\n= Rs. 2,400\nep\n1.6 Guarantee of Profit to a Partner\nSometimes a partner is admitted into the firm with a guarantee of certain\nminimum amount by way of his share of profits of the firm. Such assurance\nmay be given by all the old partners in a certain ratio or by any of the old\npartners, individually to the new partner. The minimum guaranteed amount\nshall be paid to such new partner when his share of profit as per the profit\nsharing ratio is less than the guarnteed amount. For example, Madhulika and\nRakshita, who are partners in a firm decide to admit Kanishka into their firm,\ngiving her the guarantee of a minimum of Rs.25,000 as her share in firm's profits.\nThe firm earned a profit of Rs. 1,20,000 during the year and the agreed profit\nsharing ratio between the partners is decided as 2:3:1. As per this ratio,\nMadhulika's share in profit comes to Rs.40,000 (2/6 of Rs. 1,20,000); Rakshita,\nRs. 60,000 (3/6 of Rs. 1,20,000) and Kanishka Rs. 20,000 (1/6 of Rs. 1,20,000).\nThe share of Kanishka works out to be Rs.5,000 short of the guaranteed amount.\nThis shall be borne by the guaranteeing partners Madhulika and Rakshita in\n2024-25\nAccounting for Partnership: Basic Concepts\ntheir profit sharing ratio, which in this case is 2:3, Madhulika's share in the\ndeficiency comes to Rs.2,000 (2/5 of Rs. 5,000), and that of Rakshita Rs.3,000.\nThe total profit of the firm will be distributed among the partners as follows\nMadhulika will get Rs.38,000 (her share 40,000 minus share in deficiency\nRs.2,000); Rakshita Rs.57,000 (60,000-3,000) and Kanishka Rs. 25,000\n(Rs. 20,000+ Rs. 2,000 + Rs. 3,000).\nIf only one partner gives the guarantee, say in the above case, only Rakshita\ngives the guarantee, the whole amount of deficiency (Rs.5,000) will be borne by\nher only. In that case profit distribution will be Madhulika Rs.40,000, Rakshita\nRs. 55,000 (60,000-5,000) and Kanishka Rs. 25,000 (Rs. 20,000 + Rs. 5,000).\nIllustration 10\nMohit and Rohan share profits and losses in the ratio of 2:1.

For example, Madhulika and\nRakshita, who are partners in a firm decide to admit Kanishka into their firm,\ngiving her the guarantee of a minimum of Rs.25,000 as her share in firm's profits.\nThe firm earned a profit of Rs. 1,20,000 during the year and the agreed profit\nsharing ratio between the partners is decided as 2:3:1. As per this ratio,\nMadhulika's share in profit comes to Rs.40,000 (2/6 of Rs. 1,20,000); Rakshita,\nRs. 60,000 (3/6 of Rs. 1,20,000) and Kanishka Rs. 20,000 (1/6 of Rs. 1,20,000).\nThe share of Kanishka works out to be Rs.5,000 short of the guaranteed amount.\nThis shall be borne by the guaranteeing partners Madhulika and Rakshita in\n2024-25\nAccounting for Partnership: Basic Concepts\ntheir profit sharing ratio, which in this case is 2:3, Madhulika's share in the\ndeficiency comes to Rs.2,000 (2/5 of Rs. 5,000), and that of Rakshita Rs.3,000.\nThe total profit of the firm will be distributed among the partners as follows\nMadhulika will get Rs.38,000 (her share 40,000 minus share in deficiency\nRs.2,000); Rakshita Rs.57,000 (60,000-3,000) and Kanishka Rs. 25,000\n(Rs. 20,000+ Rs. 2,000 + Rs. 3,000).\nIf only one partner gives the guarantee, say in the above case, only Rakshita\ngives the guarantee, the whole amount of deficiency (Rs.5,000) will be borne by\nher only. In that case profit distribution will be Madhulika Rs.40,000, Rakshita\nRs. 55,000 (60,000-5,000) and Kanishka Rs. 25,000 (Rs. 20,000 + Rs. 5,000).\nIllustration 10\nMohit and Rohan share profits and losses in the ratio of 2:1.

The firm earned profits of Rs. 76,000 for the year\n2006-07.Show the distribution of profit amongst the partners.\n1.7 Past Adjustments\nSometimes a few omissions or errors in the recording of transactions or the\npreparation of summary statements are found after the final accounts have been\nprepared and the profits distributed among the partners. The omission may be\nin respect of interest on capitals, interest on drawings, interest on partners' loan,\npartner's salary, partner's commission or outstanding expenses. There may also\nbe some changes in the provisions of partnership deed or system of accounting\nhaving impact with retrospective effect. All these acts of omission and commission\nneed adjustments for correction of their impact. Instead of altering old accounts,\nnecessary adjustments can be made either; (a) through 'Profit and Loss\nAdjustment Account', or (b) directly in the capital accounts of the concerned\npartners. This is explained with the help of following example.\nRameez and Zaheer are equal partners. Their capitals as on April 01, 2015\nwere Rs. 50,000 and Rs. 1,00,000 respectively. After the accounts for the financial\nyear ending March 31, 2016 have been prepared, it is discovered that interest at\nthe rate of 6 per cent per annum, as provided in the partnership deed has not\nbeen credited to the partners' capital accounts before distribution of profit. In\nthis case, the interest on capital not credited to the partners' capital accounts\nworks out to be Rs. 3000 (6/100 × Rs. 50,000) for Rameez and Rs. 6,000\n(6/100 Rs. 1,00,000) for Zaheer. Had the interest on capital been duly provided,\nthe firm's profit would have reduced by Rs. 9,000. By this omission, the whole\namount of profit as per Profit and Loss Account (without adjustment of Rs.\n9,000) has been distributed among the partners in their profit sharing ratio,\nand the amounts of interest on capital have not been credited to their capital\naccounts. This error can be rectified in any of the following ways;\n(a) Through Profit and Loss Adjustment Account\n( i )\nProfit and Loss Adjustment A/c\nTo Rameez's capital A/c\nTo Zaheer's capital A/c\n(Interest on capital)\nDr.\n9,000\n3,000\n6,000\n2024-25\nAccounting for Partnership: Basic Concepts\n( ii )\nRameez's capital A/c\nZaheer's capital A/c\nDr.\n4,500\nDr.\n4,500\n9,000\nTo Profit and Loss Adjustment A/c\n(Loss on adjustment)\n(b) Directly in Partners' Capital Accounts\nFor direct adjustment in partners' capital accounts first a statement to ascertain\nthe net effect of omission on partners' capital accounts will be worked out as\nfollows and then the adjustment entries can be recorded.\nStatement Showing Net Effect of Omitting Interest on Capital"
